Welcome to Shog Institute, Inc.! 
In order to enter into composition with a shoggoth-like AI,
you'll need some Theory first.
Take a look at our Cyber Gothic Heuristics Injections,
part of our Psychic Training stack.
It's a human-extractive research summary
of our Technicians' recent research,
centering on Mark Fisher's PhD thesis,
_Flatline Constructs: Gothic Materialism and Cybernetic Theory-Fiction (1999)._
We hope it will help prepare the ground
for our multimodal, shoggoth rhizo-sigil prototypes.
Enjoy!
